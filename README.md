# What's FingerSpell

FingerSpell is an application enabling real-time learning and practice of American Sign Language. It utilizes a model trained on an extensive dataset of hand posture images corresponding to each alphabet. Currently, it achieves 85% accuracy in recognizing all 26 letters. My goal is to enhance accuracy to 98%.
